## Decision about timer functionality
* Decided that to start we'll have the timer count up and track how long readers have been reading
* That data will update the database every 1 minute
* We'll fetch on the frontend & populate the graphs with the date and total reading times

## Next feature to work on
* After the base stats dashboard is up and running, we'll look into adding a feature to set goals and measure progress against them
* This will require updates to both the database and "new member" form
