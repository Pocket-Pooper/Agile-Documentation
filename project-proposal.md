## Project Description

The Pocket Pooper is newest bathroom necessity. Make the most of your time on the toilet, while ensuring you don't spend a minute more than you need.

## Problem statement

Going "Number Two" is a great time for reading. But, we often spend more time looking for something to read than we do reading it, and that search fatigue usually means you settle for something that wasn't worth it in the first place. Worst case scenario: you get so distracted hopping from one useless article or video to the next that you completely lose track of time, forgetting where you are and what you really came to accomplish!

## How will your project solve this problem?

Pocket Pooper solves this problem by serving quality reading material based on user-specified interests. Articles are generated based on estimated read-times, and Pocket Pooper also includes a timer to make sure you don't sit there too long.

## Map the user experience

* For the user's first time using the app, they answer a few very simple questions to determine their content interests
* To start, the user will simply hit a start button
* The screen will populate with a curated article with an approximate read time matching the timer length
* The bottom of the article will have a "next article" button for those who finish before the timer is up
* When the timer is up, the user is notified that it's time to "poop or get off the pot"

## What technologies do you plan to use?

* Backend : PostgreSQL, Knex.js
* Frontend: React.js
* Libraries: Google News API
